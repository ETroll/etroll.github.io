      <description>Second out in this little series of the 2020 Azure certification exam changes is the new AZ-204 exam that will be replacing the old AZ-203 exam.
When I was reading trough the new AZ-204 Skills Measured I quickly noticed that this new exam has a lot of changes from the old AZ-203 exam. There are however some strange changes in my opinion: requirement for Azure SQL and Azure Table Storage knowledge has been removed.</description>

It is not a total revamp, but there are some changes to important areas like Monitoring and Networking.</description>

      <description>On the 24th of January 2020 Microsoft announced changes to some of the more known Azure certification exams. The announcement was given with this blog post: Updates to Several Azure and Data &amp;amp; AI Certifications are Coming Soon As many might already know, the norm for Microsoft is to revise the the exams every 2 months and have a look at the syllabus once a year. This revision of the syllabus warranted a change in the exam numbers for some exams.</description>

      <description>Last month I revamped my old blog. I figured I wanted to write more blog articles and needed a easy platform to do so. I had previously been using Jekyll and had been quite happy. But after a look at Hugo I wanted to give that a try. Really just for the &amp;ldquo;kicks of it&amp;rdquo;.
Both are static website generators. But Hugo offers some more bells and whistles that I wanted to make use of like Shortcodes and easy templating.</description>

      <description>This post has an associated public github repository. Go check it out if you like!Some time ago I was asked by my employer if I could hold a introductory workshop in Python for two of our office locations. My Python knowledge is not all that, but I have recently (over the last year or so) started to like programming using the language. So I set out to create a workshop that I think could be productive very fast as long as you know the basics of programming.</description>

      <description>This post has an associated public github repository. Check out the entire solution here on Github.I have live-coded a few times on Twitch now. And I think it is a great platform for both learning and trying to give back to the community by streaming and putting information out there for others to learn from. On Twitch all streams have to belong to one &amp;ldquo;category&amp;rdquo;. These categories are called games on Twitch.</description>

      <description>This article have been posted on my employers official blog at an earlier time. They are the same. My post on my employers website can be found here: Webstep - Going serverless with Microsoft Azure The term “serverless” is something that we hear more and more about. It is mentioned often as the next big thing in cloud computing. There might be a small confusion on to what serverless really is, and it does not help that the cloud providers often “serverless-wash” their existing services.</description>

      <description>As a hobby project I am working on a small OS project for i386 (and ARM). Recently I was writing a driver for floppy disk drives and I stumbled on to a issue that I needed to find a solution for.
The issue was how to detect if any or how many floppy disk drives are present on a given system. I quick google informed me that the CMOS was normally used for this and the page provided some getting started information on how to detect floppy disk drives.</description>
