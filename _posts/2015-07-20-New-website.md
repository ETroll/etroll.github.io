After I took down my old website [myerart.net](http://myerart.net) I wanted to get a new site up and running. I did not want to use any CMS systems like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal etc. So I wanted to check out Jekyll. I had heard good things about this static CMS system.

From [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/):

>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

The documentation on [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) was a bit of a letdown. It helps you getting started using Jekyll, but not too much more than that. I had trouble finding some examples that I could have a look at. Jekyll is used by many bloggers, and doing a quick google I found many blog posts on how to use Jekyll and many examples on github to get inspiration from.

After having a look at some of the examples and reading the documentation I decided to choose Jekyll for my new website. Creating layouts and combine them with pages and blog posts became very easy. Jekyll gives me full control over both the design and content. So after one day I was able to create this website and host it on Github pages. And not having to worry about updating PHP or WordPress/Joomla/Drupal etc was for me a very nice bonus with using Jekyll to create my new blog.
