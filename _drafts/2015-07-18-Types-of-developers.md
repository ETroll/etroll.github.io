I have worked some years as a developer and I have started to notice that many
of the stereotypes mentioned by other developers are often very correct.

<!--more-->

## The 8-4 / 9-5 developer
 - Does not really care about the profession, just a means to an end (paycheck)


## The Manegerial aspiration one
 - Wants to be a manager and step the corporate ladder.”
 - Manager speak and nonsence
 - Did not do good in school (if any)

## The unicorn
 - Designer that have taken the step to learn programming.
 - JS
 - Normally a bad or mediocre developer, but thinks he/she is awesome..

## Enterprise
 - Care more about arciteture than resources used
 - "Just throw hardware at it"
 - Resposible for things like healthcare.gov / altinn and other behemoths
 - Often distracted by the newest buzzword and flocks to it
 - Often just wants to code in ether Java or C#

## The geek
 - Code is life
 - Multiple programming languages
 - Side projects
 - Often mistaken as the mythical "10x developer"
